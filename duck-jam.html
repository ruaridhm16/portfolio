                Keen to develop new skills, I discovered a game jam, "Duck Sauce
                Game Jam", where you and your team have 45 hours to develop a
                computer game to a specific brief given on the day. I entered
                with only a few weeks to go and decided to teach myself game
                development. Installing Unity and downloading Visual Studio Code
                for C#, I created some basic projects as building blocks; this
                was mainly a learning experience. "Duck Sauce Game Jam" was my
                first game jam, and when the jam started, the theme was revealed
                as "Flow".

              <span class="duck-jam-text06">
                Our team of three decided to write down everything we knew
                relating to flow and came up with multiple ideas. Selecting the
                one we thought would be achievable in the relatively short time
                frame. We assigned roles and created a rough timeline and
                project plan, allowing us to focus. We opted for a game where
                you row a boat following the flow of the river, picking up
                ducks. Each duck you pick up adds another layer of music to the
                game. Once you reach the bottom of the river, the game finishes,
                taking you to another level. Each level was going to have its
                own unique music. It is to be a 2D pixel art game, as that was
                the easiest to create graphics for. One essential element we
                agreed on was that the game needed to feel polished; anything
                clunky would ruin the element of flow we worked hard on. The
                game was fittingly named Duck Jam.
              </span>

              <br class="duck-jam-text10" />
              <span class="duck-jam-text11">
                Once we settled on the idea, we started coding a basic driving
                system; the boat always moves forward. Pressing A/D will change
                the rotation, so you move in a different direction. We then
                developed a camera system to follow the boat up and down with
                dampening to keep with the theme of flow, with an option for
                zoom and an option to centre the boat on the screen. Each level
                had a slightly different camera system in the end. We created a
                small collision system so if the boat intersects with the duck.
                It will add 1 to a counter, and then it will eventually add to
                the music. The movement script would also check to see if the y
                value of the boat was after a specific limit; if it were, then
                the game would finish as you have reached the end of the river.

                The art was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the development
                as we got to experiment with different designs and themes. Due
                to time constraints, we downloaded a pixel art pack for the land
                texture. We animated pixel art water and created the boat,
                ducks, user interface, and map design. Each level had to be
                different from the last while still being very easy to grasp. We
                didn't want to make a difficult and frustrating game as we felt
                "Flow," characterized by relaxation and a calming vibe. We drew
                out each level on paper, refining each design until we came to a
                design we liked.

                The music was an arduous process for us. We wanted the music to
                play on start, and each duck you collected would add a new
                "layer" to the music, eventually forming a complete melody.
                Unity's sound system made it so you cannot sync up sounds to
                start at a particular time with others. So, we came up with an
                intuitive system to prevent users from hearing any discrepancies
                in the music, such as stops/starts or slightly off-timed layers.
                For each level, we created six melodies, each with a different
                number of layers of music (For example, melody 1 has layer 1;
                melody 2 has layers 1 and 2; melody 3 has layers 1, 2, and 3,
                and so on). Then, play them all at the start, muting all but one
                each time. This system came from lots of trial and error. Then,
                a simple main menu and level select system will load a new scene
                for each level.

                We completed Duck Jam in time for submission, presenting it to
                every other competitor and talking through our development.
                Despite being the youngest and least experienced participants,
                we won the competition clearly a very successful first game.

                In my experience with the “Duck Sauce Game Jam”, I've come to
                realize how challenging it can be to develop a game within a
                limited time frame. However, it has also taught me the
                importance of teamwork and communication in such situations.
                Brainstorming, prototyping, and iterating on game ideas have
                also been valuable skills that I've gained through this
                experience.
